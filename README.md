# Reprose is a Markdown editor for GitHub

[Demo](https://reprose.pp.ua)

When I need to edit a Markdown document in GitHub, I want to use a beautiful editor that handles editing front-matter fields under the hood and supports image uploads. Thatâ€™s why I started developing my own Markdown editor for GitHub.

The current version of the editor is a working PoC (Proof of Concept) that can display a list of Markdown files from your GitHub repository, which you can edit through a basic Markdown editor.

Ideally, I want to add image uploads and an editor similar to GitBook.

The editor can be deployed to GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages. The latter is preferable because the editor app uses a simple Cloudflare function to perform GitHub authentication. If you figure out how to host it elsewhere, please let me know in the Issues.

Thanks for using this wonderful editor. :)
