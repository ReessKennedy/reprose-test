# Reprose is markdown editor for Github

When I need edit Markdown document in Github I want to use butiful editor that covers under hood editing front-matter fields and supports images upload. Thatwhy I started doing own markdown editor for Github.

Current version of editor is working PoC that can show list of markdown files from yours Github repo which you can edit through basic markdown editor.

Ideally I want to add images upload and editor that simillar to Gitbook.

The editor can be deployed to Github Pages or Cloudflare Pages. Second is the best because the editor app uses one simple Cloudflare function for perform Github authorisation. If you figure out how to host it somewhere else â€“ please let me know in Issues.

Thanks for using this wonderful editor. :)
